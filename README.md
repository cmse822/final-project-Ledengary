# CMSE 822 Final Project: K-Means Clustering

# 1. Introduction

In the modern era of computational science, efficient processing of large datasets is crucial. This project focuses on the efficiency of parallel computing paradigms in handling intensive computational tasks, specifically K-means clustering. K-means is a fundamental algorithm widely used in data mining and machine learning to group a set of objects based on attributes into K distinct groups (clusters).

K-means clustering involves partitioning n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. This mean serves as a prototype of the cluster. Given its computationally intensive nature, especially with large datasets or high dimensionality, parallel computing can play a pivotal role. Parallel computing uses multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem, which can significantly improve the computation speed and efficiency.

This project investigates the application of two parallel computing paradigms: Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on performance metrics such as computation time and efficiency in implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.

## 1.1 Background

The K-means algorithm operates through an iterative refinement technique involving:
1. **Initialization**: Defining K initial "means" (centroids).
2. **Assignment**: Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update**: Recalculating centroids as the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid.
4. **Iteration**: Repeating assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize.

Parallelizing K-means is challenging due to its iterative nature and dependencies between data points and centroids. Various strategies can be employed to distribute the workload across different processors.

## 1.2 Computational Methods

This project utilizes MPI and OpenMP for parallelization:
- **MPI** is used to distribute data points across different nodes in a computing cluster, allowing parallel processing in a distributed system.
- **OpenMP** provides thread-based parallelism suitable for shared-memory architectures, enabling multiple threads to operate on shared data structures and minimize data movement.

## 1.3 Project Statement

The project posits that applying parallel processing paradigms can significantly enhance the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm in terms of computational speed and scalability, especially as dataset sizes increase.
