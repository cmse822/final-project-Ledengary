# CMSE 822 Final Project: K-Means Clustering

This project aims to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm in a parallel computing environment using C++. By leveraging OpenMP for multithreading, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency and performance of the K-Means algorithm in processing large datasets. The focus is on demonstrating the effectiveness of parallelization in speeding up the computation of cluster assignments and centroid updates, thus providing a scalable solution for clustering problems.
